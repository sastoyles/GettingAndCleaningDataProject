### Variables
activity: Participants were assessed during 6 different activities--sitting, standing, laying, walking, walking up stairs, and walking downstairs. 

subjectID: Each subject was assigned a number between 1 and 30.

averages of means and standard deviations: each subject had multiple mean and standard deviation measurements for the following signals that were extracted from the original data. Data was furthered summarized to create the average mean and standard deviation for each activity for each subject for all signals.
* tBodyAcc-XYZ
* tGravityAcc-XYZ
* tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
* tBodyGyro-XYZ
* tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
* tBodyAccMag
